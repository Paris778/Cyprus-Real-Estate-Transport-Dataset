# Cyprus-Real-Estate-and-Transport-Dataset

The small island nation of the republic of Cyprus is a major financial center in West Europe and the Medditerrenean, having drawn investments from global industry giants and counties such as Russia during the recent years, especially in the field of Real Estate.
